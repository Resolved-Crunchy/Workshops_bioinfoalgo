This repository contains a couple of sample projects from my Bioinformatics Algorithms class. All files were written in C++ and represent imperfect implementations of known bioinformatics algorithms for the sake of education. If you would like to touch up one or any of these files, please feel free! Please note that these files represent work from years ago for a class, and may not function when run with files of a different format than the test set.
